# Workspace

## Overview

This workspace hosts **Arcana** — a Python multi-tenant Telegram bot
platform with hibernating runtimes, wallet billing in "crystals", and
an autonomous coding agent (Builder Agent) powered by Anthropic Claude.

> Renamed from the older codename **ZeroBot** (April 2026). All module
> paths and environment variables now use the `arcana` namespace.

See `README.md` for the full product description and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
for the contributor guide.

### Running the services

Each service is a separate process. See the **Quick start** section of
`README.md` for the exact `uvicorn` / `python -m` invocations.

| Service       | Module                          | Default port                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Gateway       | `arcana.core.gateway:app`       | 8001                                  |
| User Console  | `arcana.api.user_console:app`   | 8000                                  |
| Admin Console | `arcana.api.admin_console:app`  | 8002                                  |
| Builder Bot   | `arcana.bots.builder_bot.main`  | (Telegram polling)                    |
| Manager Bot   | `arcana.bots.manager_bot.main`  | 8003 (events) + Telegram polling      |

## Configuration

All runtime configuration is read from environment variables (or a
`.env` file at the project root). See `.env.example` for the full list
of keys and their descriptions. Secrets that must **never** be
committed:

- `ADMIN_TOKEN`
- `BUILDER_BOT_TOKEN`, `MANAGER_BOT_TOKEN`
- `AI_INTEGRATIONS_ANTHROPIC_*`
- `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PHONE_HMAC_KEY` (Phase 0 identity layer)
- `EVENT_SHARED_SECRET` (HMAC signing for fire-and-forget events)
- `DATABASE_URL` (when it contains a real password)

## Phase 0 — Identity layer (built April 2026)

The platform enforces a Telegram phone-verification gate before any
bot is created or any Builder Agent turn is run (admins are exempt;
can be globally disabled via `REQUIRE_PHONE_VERIFICATION=false` for
tests).

- **`arcana/security/`** — versioned AES-GCM envelopes (with AAD) and
  HMAC helpers. Master keys resolved from env, with a deterministic
  dev fallback and loud warning when unset.
- **`arcana/identity/`** — phone normalization (E.164), HMAC-based
  dedup, bot-quota check (default 3 per phone), and encrypted MTProto
  session storage (substrate for Phase 1 BotFather automation).
- **DB additions** — `User` gained `phone_encrypted` (BYTEA),
  `phone_hash` (unique partial index), `phone_verified_at`,
  `bot_quota`. New tables: `bot_owner_sessions`,
  `phone_verification_log`, `botfather_operations`. Columns added via
  `ADDITIVE_MIGRATIONS` so existing deployments upgrade cleanly.
- **Builder Bot** — `request_contact` keyboard on first use;
  `/unlink_phone` for GDPR-style deletion.
- **User Console** — `POST /users/{id}/bots` returns HTTP 403 with
  `phone_verification_required` or `bot_quota_exceeded` when the gates
  fail.
- **Admin Console + Manager Bot** — `/identity`, `/unverify`,
  `/unlink_session`, `/setquota` admin overrides.

## Phase 1.ج — BotFather automation, Bot API portion (April 2026)

Users can manage their planted bots' public profile (name,
descriptions, slash-commands) from inside Arcana — without ever
opening @BotFather. Photo uploads, token rotation, and bot deletion
ship in a follow-up phase that needs an MTProto user session.

- **`arcana/botfather/`** — async `BotFatherClient` wrapping the
  Telegram Bot API self-management endpoints (`getMe`,
  `set/getMyName`, `set/getMyDescription`, `set/getMyShortDescription`,
  `set/getMyCommands`, `deleteMyCommands`). Local validation matches
  Telegram's documented limits so we fail fast.
- **Service layer** — `fetch_bot_profile()` and `update_bot_profile()`
  enforce ownership (`bot.user_id == caller`) and write one
  `BotFatherOperation` audit row per attempted op. Partial updates
  only hit the fields the caller passes; per-field failures are
  reported in the response without aborting the rest.
- **User Console API** — `GET /users/{uid}/bots/{bid}/profile` reads
  the live profile; `PATCH /users/{uid}/bots/{bid}/profile` accepts
  any subset of `{name, description, short_description, commands}`.
  Phone gate enforced (admins exempt).
- **Builder Bot** — new commands: `/mybots`, `/profile <bot_id>`,
  `/setname <bot_id> <name>`, `/setdesc <bot_id> <desc>`,
  `/setabout <bot_id> <about>`. All gated on phone verification.
- **Tests** — 15 tests using `httpx.MockTransport` (no real network)
  cover client validation, transport happy paths, error surfacing,
  ownership enforcement, partial updates, audit logging, and
  per-field failure recording.

## Documentation conventions

- **English** is the default language for code, docstrings, and module
  headers — that's the lingua franca of the Python ecosystem and keeps
  the door open for international contributors.
- **Arabic** is used inline (in dedicated `# ar:` comment blocks) to
  explain *why* a non-obvious design decision was made — the kind of
  thing that would otherwise be lost in a future grep. The convention
  is `# ar: …` so these blocks are easy to find and translate later.

## Notes

- The `artifacts/` directory contains an unrelated pnpm/TypeScript
  template that was scaffolded by the workspace; Arcana itself does
  not depend on it. The workflow `Start application` runs the
  TypeScript artifact for live preview only.
- Per-bot virtualenvs and Builder Agent sandbox workspaces live under
  `arcana/runtime_envs/` and are gitignored (see `.gitignore`).
- The pytest suite passes 157/157 tests against an in-memory SQLite DB
  (no external services required).

## Reusable middleware & services (Wave 1 port from rdfsx/aiogram-template)

After analysing `rdfsx/aiogram-template` we ported only the patterns that
fit Arcana's architecture (skipping its MongoDB/Russian-UI assumptions):

- **`arcana/bots/middleware/`** — bot-agnostic middlewares shared by
  Builder Bot and Manager Bot:
  - `ThrottlingMiddleware` — pure-Python per-(user, handler) sliding-
    window limiter (no `aiolimiter` dep). Handlers can opt into a custom
    rate via `@throttle(seconds)`.
  - `DBSessionMiddleware` — opens an `AsyncSession` per handler call and
    rolls back on uncaught exceptions. Handlers receive the session via
    aiogram DI (`session=` kwarg).
  - `build_error_router(bot_label, apology_text=None)` — global error
    catcher that logs the trace, emits a typed `bot_error` event to the
    Manager Bot's `/events` endpoint, and optionally apologises to the
    user. Returns a `Router` ready to `include_router(...)`.
- **`arcana/services/broadcast.py`** — `broadcast_text(bot, user_ids,
  text, ...)` helper that handles `TelegramRetryAfter` (sleeps + retries
  once), `TelegramForbiddenError` (counts blocked users + invokes
  `on_blocked` hook), and other API errors. Returns a `BroadcastResult`
  dataclass with `sent / blocked / failed / total` counters. Accepts
  both sync iterables and async generators (for streamed DB cursors).

### New events flowing through the platform event bus

- `user_registered` — fired exactly once on first phone-verification.
  Now carries `username`, `full_name`, `language`, `telegram_user_id`
  and a `photo_file_id` (the user's largest available profile photo,
  reusable across bots so the Manager Bot re-sends it via `send_photo`
  with no re-upload).
- `user_blocked_bot` / `user_unblocked_bot` — emitted from the new
  `my_chat_member` handler in Builder Bot, so admins are notified the
  moment a user blocks/un-blocks the bot.
- `bot_error` — emitted by every bot's error router on any un-handled
  exception (carries `bot`, `error`, `user_id`, `update_id`, `trace`).
- `broadcast_completed` — emitted at the end of every `/broadcast`
  with `sent / blocked / failed / total` counts.

### New Builder Bot command

- `/broadcast <message>` — admin-only, throttled at 5s/call. Selects
  every user with `phone_verified_at IS NOT NULL`, sends in parallel
  with the broadcast service, and posts a final summary to the admin.
  Localised in all 6 supported languages (ar / en / fr / es / ru / tr).

### Test coverage added

- `tests/test_throttling_middleware.py` (7 tests) — drop, isolation by
  user/handler, decorator override, no-user pass-through.
- `tests/test_db_session_middleware.py` (3 tests) — session injection,
  commit visibility, rollback-on-exception (uses `aiosqlite`).
- `tests/test_broadcast_service.py` (7 tests) — success, blocked +
  callback, FloodWait retry, generic API errors, progress callback,
  async-iterable input.

## Wave 2 — Manybot-inspired admin features (April 2026)

Wave 2 builds on Wave 1's middleware foundation to give the platform
admin proper tooling around the user base. None of it required a new
service; the work is split between a tiny new persistence helper, a
few admin-console endpoints, and updates to both bots.

### Schema additions (no Alembic — `Base.metadata.create_all`)

- `users.is_blocked` (`Boolean`, server default `false`) +
  `users.blocked_at` (`DateTime UTC`) — populated from the
  `my_chat_member` handler whenever Telegram tells us a user
  blocked/un-blocked the Builder Bot.
- New `platform_settings` table (`key TEXT PK`, `value TEXT`,
  `updated_at`, `updated_by`) — single home for admin-tunable knobs.

### New service — `arcana/services/platform_settings.py`

Thin async helper around the new table: `get_setting(session, key)`,
`set_setting(session, key, value, updated_by=None)` (upsert),
`delete_setting(session, key)`, `list_settings(session)`. Exports
`KEY_WELCOME_MESSAGE = "welcome_message"` so both bots reference the
same constant and can never drift apart.

### Admin-console (FastAPI) changes

- `GET /admin/users` now returns a `UserListPage` (`items`, `total`,
  `limit`, `offset`) and accepts `limit` (1–500), `offset`, and a
  case-insensitive `search` substring filter. Each row includes
  `is_blocked` + `blocked_at`.
- `GET /admin/stats` adds `users_verified`, `users_blocked`,
  `users_today`, `users_this_week` (all UTC, week = past 7 days).
- New `/admin/settings` surface: `GET` lists all, `GET /{key}`
  returns one (`404` if absent), `PUT /{key}` upserts (records the
  optional `X-Admin-User` header as the editor for audit), `DELETE
  /{key}` removes (`404` if absent). All emit
  `platform_setting_changed` / `platform_setting_deleted` events.

### Builder Bot updates

- `/start` now reads `KEY_WELCOME_MESSAGE` from `platform_settings`
  on every call and prepends it to the standard role/balance card.
  No restart is required when the admin changes the welcome text.
- `my_chat_member` handler persists `is_blocked` / `blocked_at` to
  the DB (creating the row if needed) *before* firing
  `user_blocked_bot` / `user_unblocked_bot` — so the broadcast
  service can skip dead chats up-front instead of paying Telegram's
  per-bot rate-limit cost.
- `/broadcast` now filters `User.is_blocked.is_(False)` in SQL and
  passes an `on_blocked` callback that flips `is_blocked=True` on
  any users Telegram rejects mid-broadcast.

### Manager Bot updates

- `/users [search]` is now paginated with an inline keyboard
  (`◀ Prev` / `Next ▶`, 10 rows/page). Each row is a tappable
  button (`u:show:<id>`) that opens the full user-detail card.
  `AdminFilter` was extended so it also gates `CallbackQuery`
  updates, not just messages.
- `/stats` shows the new verified / blocked / signups-today /
  signups-this-week breakdown.
- New customisation commands: `/getwelcome`, `/setwelcome <text>`,
  `/clearwelcome` — all hit the new admin-console settings
  endpoints with the admin's chat-id passed via `X-Admin-User`.

### Test coverage added

- `tests/test_platform_settings.py` (8 tests) — service round-trip,
  overwrite semantics, audit metadata, list, delete, key constant.
- `tests/test_admin_console_settings.py` (7 tests) — full HTTP
  surface (PUT/GET/LIST/DELETE/404/401) against an in-memory SQLite
  DB via `dependency_overrides`.
- `tests/test_admin_console_pagination.py` (8 tests) —
  `UserListPage` shape, `limit`, `offset`, `search` (case-insensitive
  substring), no-match behaviour, auth, presence of `is_blocked`.
- `tests/test_admin_console_stats.py` (6 tests) — verifies the four
  new counters and that "today"/"this week" exclude back-dated rows.

Total suite: **186 tests** (was 157 at end of Wave 1).
