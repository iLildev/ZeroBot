"""BotFather automation — manage a planted bot's profile from inside Arcana.

Phase 1.ج (Bot API portion): everything reachable through the public
Telegram Bot API using a bot token. The MTProto-only operations
(profile photo, deletion, token rotation) ship in a follow-up phase
once the user-session linking flow is wired to the Mini App.
