"""Security primitives — symmetric encryption and HMAC helpers.

This package centralizes the cryptography used everywhere else in the
project so we have a single, reviewed surface for key handling, AEAD
envelopes, and HMACs. Nothing in this package should ever read or write
the database, so it stays trivial to unit-test.
